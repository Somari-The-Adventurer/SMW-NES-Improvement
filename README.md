# SMW-NES-Disassembly
This is a very WIP disassembly of the unlicensed Dendy port of SMW. There's a [Discord](https://discord.gg/3rJSuzqzmE) if you want to assist with the disassembly or documentation.

# How to compile
Run "compile.bat". You'll have to rip the .chr yourself.

# To-do:
-Try documenting some of the collision code.\
-Document how warp data works, specifically the data in the latter half of bank 36.\
-Finish fixing the labels, cleaning, and organizing the music ASM. As of right now, they're extremely messy.
